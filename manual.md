# Start Here
## Intro
Welcome to Troll Town, a game of communication, cooperation, competition and feasting on children. Some manual dexterity is required to play.

## Setup
Before you play, agree on the Win Condition(s). One free hovel to start per two players. Use straight three hex as Bridge. Surround the hub with hexes in some fashion. Pointy outs are ok. Place Boss Hut somewhere near Hub and connect with paths.

Decide on Troll Stats, balance out 15 points into 5 catagories.

## Game Concepts
## Turns
A game of Troll Town is conducted over the course of 40 turns. A turn consists of declaring actions simultaneously (see 'Confusing Bits').

### Actions
Actions are declared at the same time, and resolve in the following order.

- Boss Action -> Minion Orders
- Troll Action -> Minion Orders

This is accomplished by the Trolls:
**Planning**
- Declaring troll / minion actions by placing tokens on slate, hiding if desired.
- Each Troll will exclaim 'ready' or grunt when done.

Once all Trolls are ready, players declare Actions and Orders in the same order they announced. If an order is Planned, it MUST be Declared.

**Declaration**
- Troll: Declare Action, Resolve Conflicts
  - All Trolls finish Action before Minion Orders are declared.
  - Conflicts are resolved before Orders.
- Minion: Declare Orders, Resolve Conflicts
  - Players declare their Orders one at a time by stating the Construction and required workers
  - An insufficient number of Communal Workers causes a Conflict

#### Era Specific Actions
    I : Challenge Boss, Child, Minion
    II: Upgrade Hovel, Heal, Schmooze, Smash
    III: Upgrade Pile, Scare, Fight, Destroy
    IV: Fire

#### Post Turn
Minions must stay in Hovels or Huts and Children must be placed in Cages or Huts. Otherwise they run away and are removed from the board.

## Feast Day
The whole point of building a Troll Town is Feast Day.
All injuries are healed.
Feasting automatically occurs at the end of Turn 10, 20, 30 and 40, unless triggered earlier by the Troll Boss.
On Feast Day, there must be 4, 16, 25 and 40 children captured, and sufficient Workshops to cook them.  Otherwise the Boss throws a Tantrum.
Keep overage children for next Feast.

### Trolls
Each player is a Troll and takes an Action each Turn. There is also a Non-Player Troll Boss. At the beginning of the game, Trolls live on the Bridge, and move to a Hut when one is built.

#### Troll Stats
Trolls have five stats, Muscles, Skin, Guts, Brains and Speed. These are assigned values by the player totaling 15. All stats increase by 1 when a Troll has a Hut, and by another 1 when that Hut has a Pile attached for a total of +2 to all stats.

### Minions
Minions are slave creatures captured when Trolls do a Capture Worker action.

Minions are either communal or private, decided by where they are placed at the time of capture.

#### Communal Minions
Communal Minions live 2 to a Hovel. These are drawn upon for Constructions by all Trolls.

#### Private Minions
A Mud Hut supports 2 Private Minions, a Wood Hut supports 6. One Hovel can be added as an upgrade to a Hut to house an additional two workers, one of which will be a Servant. The Boss Hut can support multiple Hovels, and doesn't have a Servant requirement. Private Minions may only be used by the owning Troll.

##### Servants & Artisans
To facilitate upgrades Private Minions are used as a permanent labor force in a Hut or Shop. Once a Private Minion becomes a Servant or a Artisan, they are no longer a Private Minion and are permanently assigned to a building hovel. Move the Private Minion token to the Upgrade Hovel as part of the Upgrade Action.

## Confusing Bits

### Every Turn Is Taken Simultaneously

Troll Actions & Minion Orders can cause Conflicts. Boss Actions and Boss Minion Orders never cause Conflicts, instead take Priority over Actions & Orders.

Troll Actions can Conflict. If, for example, two Trolls choose the "Capture Child" Action, they will conflict. However, if both Trolls instead chose the "Capture Minion" Action, there is no conflict. ( See Troll Actions )

Players declare Minion Orders, then collect the required minions from their dwellings. Multiple players going after the same Minion results in a Conflict.After the first round of buildings are complete, subsequent rounds occur.

### In-Game Disputes Solved with Combat
When player chopsticks touch, this is considered a Conflict.
(ie. taking someone elses worker token )
At site of infraction, or at intersection between Huts.

### Round up.
50% of 3 is 2. 50% of 1 is 1.
( 3 escaped children hit a dead end. 2 escape. 1 is recaptured)

## Troll Actions
Parenthesis indicates Location of Conflict. I means an Intersection between the Troll Dwellings.

### I

**Do not conflict**

- Get Resource - Add worker

**Conflict**

- Capture Child (I) - Add children to hovel, cage or pit
- Challenge (I) - Resolves amongst Trolls, then Boss.

### II

**No Conflict**

- Smash - Break a Damaged Path Join. Conflict will break it anyway.

**Can Conflict If Not Enough Shops**

- Upgrade - (Shop) - Upgrade Hut / Shop with Hovel / Pile
- Heal (Shop) - Remove one injury token

**Will Conflict**

- Schmooze (I) - Build w/o Conflict. Can cause Conflict. Costs 1 Private Worker.
- Scare (Cage) - One cage / pit will not escape. Conflict causes escape.

### III
**Conflict**
- Fight (I) - Start fight, steal worker.
- Destroy ( Target ) - Destroy Path or Building ( 1 private worker per hex ). Closest Hut Troll will Challenge. Cannot be used on other Huts, Bridge, Inner Path or Hub.

### IV
- Start fire - Sacrifice private worker. Start fire on Path.

## Minion Orders:
Build (Hex) - Conflict happens when building on same hex

# Constructions:
The *Inner Path* comprises of the Path hexes surrounding the Hub.

The *Bridge* is the vertical 3-tile piece on top of the Hub.

## Building rules
- Conflicts must be resolved before building.

- No Paths or Buildings can go beyond an imaginary horizontal line formed by the top Path Join of the top Bridge tile.
- Must be a Path between Hub and target Construction.
- Huts cannot be placed off the Inner Path. Trolls like some privacy.
- Buildings must have sufficient supporting Path Joins ( required number indicated with building) to be built.

> For Example: A Shop must have 4 Path Joins

- Buildings may be made with Workers gained by Trolls this turn.

> For Example: On turn 1, a cage can be built if one worker is captured*

# Child Escape
## Rules
During Conflict, any cage / pit within 3 hexes has all Children escape.
During Challenge, all children attempt escape.
Escape starts at release square, closest to nearest Bridge.
More then one child automatically split into two groups at Release Square.
## Pathing Mechanics
Every group has a Turn Pattern which are decisions considered called Pathing.
L R LR RL LRL RLR LRR RRL
Pathing determines which direction the children run once escaped, and the subsequent decisions they make when reaching Decision Points following Paths.

### Turn Around
When a Group encounters the end of a path that has a building attached, they turn around 180°.

## Resolutions:
### Escape -
  If a Group reaches the Bridge Hex that touches the Hub, they are considered to all have escaped. If a Group reaches a Dead End, meaning a single Path tile with no buildings attached.
  50% escape / 50% reverse

### Recapture -
  Ends up back at original release square

### Eaten -
  If Group reaches a Dead End next to a Hut, they enter the Hut and are Eaten. This does not count towards a Feast.


## Special Children
Every Group has special characteristics.

### Considerate :
  When next to another cage / pit, add all Children to group, add another characteristic.
### Brave :
  100% escape at dead ends
### Hider :
  Will Hide if Pathed into Hovel, Pile or Workshop. Escapes again at beginning of next turn continuing in the same direction, no split.
### Self-Preservation :
  Will not Path into Huts


## Conflicts
### Resource Conflicts
When there are insufficient workers to complete a Construction or Action. Conflict occurs near worker dwelling.
### Building Conflicts
When two Constructions occur on the same hex. Conflict happens on nearest Path Join to that Hex.
### Intersection Conflicts
When two Trolls try to do a Conflicting Action, such as capturing Children.

### Conflict Rules
Resolve Resource Conflicts before Building Conflicts
Conflicts always occur at the closest Path Join to the Intersection or Conflict Location. If there are multiple Path Joins equidistant from the Location, use one closer to the Dwelling of the Infracting Troll, the one who started the Conflict. ( ie. Resource Conflict, the Troll who wanted to use the worker, not the Troll who first took the worker )

#### Speed Rule
In determining Intersection Locations, a special rule may be used. Each player may count a number of hexes corresponding to their Troll Speed in ticks moving from their Dwelling towards eachother. Thus, a Troll with a speed of 6 against a speed of 2 will Conflict much closer to the Dwelling belonging to the slower Troll.

### Conflict Resolution
Once a Location is determined, draw one Attack card which will indicate a stat. The Troll with the higher stat is the Winner and accomplishes the action which caused the Conflict. The other troll recieves an Injury to the stat indicated.

In case of a tie, the Location is Damaged if Intact, Broken if Damaged.
After the damage is done, the fight continues with another Attack.

If, due to Damage, a Location no longer exists, the Location is moved to a new  Intersecting Path Join.

### >2 Combatants
When multiple Trolls Conflict, attacks occur in a clockwise direction, and when a Troll is injured, they leave combat. Once two remain, complete Conflict as above.

### Challenges
Five Conflicts. Keep going in case of 5 ties. When Location is destroyed, find another Intersection, through buildings if a Path Intersection cannot be found. If there is still no Intersection, do 5 battles, and determine the winner of the group.


## Damage

### Path Damage
Paths Joins have three states, Intact, Damaged and Broken.
When a Construction is Broken, it is removed from the board.
When a Path is Damaged, it is marked with a token.

### Broken Paths
If a Path has one Path Join Broken, it becomes a candidate for removal. This will result in two hex candidates.

#### Path Hex Removal Determination
Each hex is assigned a point value, the hex with a greater point value stays. A tie removes both Hexes.

> Path Joins = -1
>
> Damaged Path Joins = -2
>
> Building Connections = +1
>
> Path Connection = +1
>
> Inner Path = +1
>
> Bridge = +10

#### Path Hex Removal Action
Replace Path tile with a smaller one. ( 4 hex > 3 Hex, 3 > 2, 2 > 1, 1 > removed ). When a Path is removed, all Buildings connected to that Path are also Destroyed, unless connected to another Path.

### Building Damage:
If a Path Hex is removed, any attached buildings suffer one damage. Buildings can be Broken if they are Damaged one for each hex.
(If a Hovel is Damaged once, it is Broken. A workshop must be damaged three times to be Broken)

### Broken Buildings
If a building is Broken, flip the tile over. This space is full of debris and cannot be used.


# Troll Boss

## Boss Stats
By default, the Boss is completely average, with a Hut, thus having stats of 4/4/4/4/4.

## Boss Actions
Intimidate : Steal Worker

# Advanced Version

### Income & Resources

#### Income vs Resources
Income represents flow of supplies, and is not diminished when used for Building.

Private resources must be stored in a Primary Dwelling.
Mud Hut - 2
Wood Hut - 4
Clay Hut - 8
Hut With Attached Pile + 10

#### Trinkets
Trinkets add one to any Troll stat. One trinket is made when a Troll has two private resources and has one available worker and selects the "Make Trinket" action. Trolls can make as many Trinkets as they want at one time, provided they have sufficient workers and resources.

#### Improved Resources
Improved Resources are the result of a workshop transformation and are used instantly, returning the income at the beginning of next turn.
Sticks > Wood - Upgrade Shops / Piles / Pits - Hunting Tools
Food > Good Food - Heal injuries
Mud > Clay - Upgrade Hut
String > Rope -  Upgrade Shops / Piles / Pits - Hunting Tools

### Advanced Boss Actions:
