# Start Here
## Intro
Welcome to Troll Town, a game of communication, cooperation, competition and feasting on children. Some manual dexterity is required to play.

## Setup
Before you play, agree on the Win Condition(s). One free hovel to start per two players. Use straight three hex as Bridge. Surround the hub with hexes in some fashion. Pointy outs are ok. Place Boss Hut somewhere near Hub and connect with paths.

Decide on Troll Stats, balance out 15 points into 5 catagories.

# Game Concepts
## Turns
A game of Troll Town is conducted over the course of 40 turns. A turn consists of declaring actions simultaneously (see 'Confusing Bits').

### Actions
Actions are declared at the same time, and resolve in the following order.

- Boss Action -> Minion Orders
- Troll Action -> Minion Orders

#### PreTurn
This is accomplished by the Trolls:
**Planning**
- Declaring troll / minion actions by placing tokens on slate, hiding if desired.
- Each Troll will exclaim 'ready' or grunt when done.

Once all Trolls are ready, players declare Actions and Orders in the same order they announced. If an order is Planned, it MUST be Declared. This is ensured by placing tokens on the card.

**Declaration**
- Troll: Declare Action, Resolve Conflicts
  - All Trolls finish Action before Minion Orders are declared.
  - Conflicts are resolved before Orders.
- Minion: Declare Orders, Resolve Conflicts
  - Players declare their Orders one at a time by stating the Construction and required Minions
  - An insufficient number of Communal Workers causes a Conflict


#### Post Turn
Minions must stay in Hovels or Huts and Children must be placed in Cages or Huts. Otherwise they run away and are removed from the board.

#### Era Specific Actions
    I : Challenge Boss, Capture Child, Capture Minion, Slave Drive
    II: Upgrade Hovel, Steal, Heal, Schmooze, Make Trap, Craft Tool, Destroy
    III: Upgrade Pile, Scare, Upgrade Hut with Shop, Make Trinket
    IV: Fire, Upgrade Hut With Pile

## Feast Day
The whole point of building a Troll Town is Feast Day.
All injuries are healed.
Feasting automatically occurs at the end of Turn 10, 20, 30 and 40.
On Feast Day, there must be 4, 16, 25 and 40 children captured, and sufficient Workshops to cook them.  Otherwise the Boss throws a Tantrum.
Keep overage children for next Feast.

## Trolls
Each player is a Troll and takes an Action each Turn. There is also a Non-Player Troll Boss. At the beginning of the game, Trolls live on the Bridge, and move to a Hut when one is built.

### Troll Stats
Trolls have five stats, Muscles, Skin, Guts, Brains and Speed. These are assigned values by the player totaling 15. All stats increase by 1 when a Troll has a Hut, and by another 1 when that Hut has a Pile attached for a total of +2 to all stats.

## Minions
Minions are slave creatures captured when Trolls do a Capture Worker action.

Minions are either communal or private, decided by where they are placed at the time of capture.

### Communal Minions
Communal Minions live 2 to a Hovel. These are drawn upon for Constructions by all Trolls.

### Private Minions
A Mud Hut supports 2 Private Minions, a Wood Hut supports 6. One Hovel can be added as an upgrade to a Hut to house an additional two Minions, one of which will be a Servant. The Boss Hut can support multiple Hovels, and doesn't have a Servant requirement. Private Minions may only be used by the owning Troll.

#### Servants, Guards & Artisans
To facilitate upgrades Private Minions are used as a permanent labor force in a Pit, Hut or Shop. Once a Private Minion becomes a Guard, Servant or a Artisan, they are no longer considered a Private Minion and are permanently assigned to a building hovel. Move a Private Minion token to an Upgraded Hovel as part of every Upgrade Action.

##### Huts
Keep your Private Minions on your Hut and your Servants inside the Hovels.

##### Shops
Keep 1, then 2 Artisans in the Hut as you upgrade to Hovel, then Pile.

##### Pit
For each level of Pit Upgrade, two Guards must be placed in the Hovels attached to the Pit.



## Confusing Bits

### Every Turn Is Taken Simultaneously

Troll Actions & Minion Orders can cause Conflicts. Boss Actions and Boss Minion Orders never cause Conflicts, instead take Priority over Actions & Orders.

Troll Actions can Conflict. If, for example, two Trolls choose the "Capture Child" Action, they will conflict. However, if both Trolls instead chose the "Capture Minion" Action, there is no conflict. ( See Troll Actions )

Players declare Minion Orders, then collect the required minions from their dwellings. Multiple players going after the same Minion results in a Conflict.After the first round of buildings are complete, subsequent rounds occur.

### In-Game Disputes Solved with Combat
When player chopsticks touch, this is considered a Conflict.
(ie. taking someone elses Minion token )
At site of infraction, or at intersection between Huts.

### Round up.
50% of 3 is 2. 50% of 1 is 1.
( 3 escaped children hit a dead end. 2 escape. 1 is recaptured)

## Troll Actions
Parenthesis indicates Location of Conflict. I means an Intersection between the Troll Dwellings.

# Child Escape
## Rules
During Conflict, any cage / pit within 3 hexes has all Children escape.
During Challenge, all children attempt escape.
Escape starts at release square, closest to nearest Bridge.
More then one child automatically split into two groups at Release Square.
## Pathing Mechanics
Every group has a Turn Pattern which are decisions considered called Pathing.
LR RL LRL RLR LRR RRL
Pathing determines which direction the children run once escaped, and the subsequent decisions they make when reaching Decision Points following Paths.
If a child reaches the Inner Path, they can smell fresh air and cannot be recaptured or eaten.

### Turn Around
When a Group encounters the end of a path that has a building attached, they turn around 180°.

## Resolutions:
### Escape -
  If a Group reaches the Bridge Hex that touches the Hub, they are considered to all have escaped. If a Group reaches a Dead End, meaning a single Path tile with no buildings attached.
  50% escape / 50% reverse

### Recapture -
  Ends up back at original release square

### Eaten -
  If Group reaches a Dead End next to a Hut, they enter the Hut and are Eaten. This does not count towards a Feast.


## Special Children
Every Group has special characteristics.

### Considerate :
  When next to another cage / pit, add all Children to group, add another characteristic.
### Brave :
  100% escape at dead ends
### Hider :
  Will Hide if Pathed into Hovel, Pile or Workshop. Escapes again at beginning of next turn continuing in the same direction, no split.
### Self-Preservation :
  Will not Path into Huts


## Returning as Adults
The turn after children escape, adults return to lay waste to Troll Town. For each Child that escapes, return 1 Adult, starting at the bridge.

### Adult Behavior
Each adult will determine Pathing Pattern as a child, but instead of repeating at the end of a path sequence, the adult breaks the nearest Path Join.

### Boats
Groups of 4 Adults will raid in boats. Boats are represented by cards thrown from the top orientation from a short distance away (2-5 feet), aiming at the bridge. If the thrown card doesn't touch any game piece, re-orient the throw from where the card lies. Boats land on sections of Troll Town determined where a thrown card lies.   After landing, Adults will start at the nearest Hex.

### Traps

Trolls can prepare for Adults by building Traps.

#### Spikes

Spikes cost 6 Minions to build and occupy a hex. Spikes cannot be placed on the Inner Path. Spikes prevent Adults from proceeding, and remove the first Adult who triggers them. The triggered Spikes are removed from the board after all Adult Pathing is resolved.

#### Fences

Fences use 10 Minions to deploy. Fences prevent boats from landing, if a boat hits only a fence, not a building or hex.

## Conflicts
### Resource Conflicts
When there are insufficient Minions to complete a Construction or Action. Conflict occurs near Minion dwelling.
### Building Conflicts
When two Constructions occur on the same hex. Conflict happens on nearest Path Join to that Hex.
### Intersection Conflicts
When two Trolls try to do a Conflicting Action, such as capturing Children.

### Conflict Rules
Resolve Resource Conflicts before Building Conflicts
Conflicts always occur at the closest Path Join to the Intersection or Conflict Location. If there are multiple Path Joins equidistant from the Location, use one closer to the Dwelling of the Infracting Troll, the one who started the Conflict. ( ie. Resource Conflict, the Troll who wanted to use the Minion, not the Troll who first took the Minion )

#### Speed Rule
In determining Intersection Locations, a special rule may be used. Each player may count a number of hexes corresponding to their Troll Speed in ticks moving from their Dwelling towards eachother. Thus, a Troll with a speed of 6 against a speed of 2 will Conflict much closer to the Dwelling belonging to the slower Troll.

### Conflict Resolution
Once a Location is determined, draw one Attack card which will indicate a stat. The Troll with the higher stat is the Winner and accomplishes the action which caused the Conflict. The other troll recieves an Injury to the stat indicated.

In case of a tie, the Location is Damaged if Intact, Broken if Damaged.
After the damage is done, the fight continues with another Attack.

If, due to Damage, a Location no longer exists, the Location is moved to a new  Intersecting Path Join.

### >2 Combatants
When multiple Trolls Conflict, attacks occur in a clockwise direction, and when a Troll is injured, they leave combat. Once two remain, complete Conflict as above.

### Challenges
Five Conflicts. Keep going in case of 5 ties. When Location is destroyed, find another Intersection, through buildings if a Path Intersection cannot be found. If there is still no Intersection, do 5 battles, and determine the winner of the group.


## Damage

### Path Damage
Paths Joins have three states, Intact, Damaged and Broken.
When a Construction is Broken, it is removed from the board.
When a Path is Damaged, it is marked with a token.

### Broken Paths
If a Path has one Path Join Broken, it becomes a candidate for removal. This will result in two hex candidates.

#### Path Hex Removal Determination
Each hex is assigned a point value, the hex with a greater point value stays. A tie removes both Hexes.

> Path Joins = -1
>
> Damaged Path Joins = -2
>
> Building Connections = +1
>
> Path Connection = +1
>
> Inner Path = +1
>
> Bridge = +10

#### Path Hex Removal Action
Replace Path tile with a smaller one. ( 4 hex > 3 Hex, 3 > 2, 2 > 1, 1 > removed ). When a Path is removed, all Buildings connected to that Path are also Destroyed, unless connected to another Path.

### Building Damage:
If a Path Hex is removed, any attached buildings suffer one damage. Buildings can be Broken if they are Damaged one for each hex.
(If a Hovel is Damaged once, it is Broken. A workshop must be damaged three times to be Broken)

### Broken Buildings
If a building is Broken, flip the tile over. This space is full of debris and cannot be used.

# Troll Boss

## Boss Targets
The Troll who has most recently Challenged or Stolen from the Troll Boss, are the top priority for Intimidation and Tantrums. After that, or if no Troll has bothered the Boss, the target is the Troll with the closest Hut to the Boss Hut, in the case of Intimidation, or the last Hut visited, in the case of a Tantrum.

## Boss Stats
By default, the Boss is completely average, with a Hut, thus having stats of 4/4/4/4/4.

## Boss Actions
Intimidate : Steal Worker
Strike : Cause Injury

## Boss Minion Actions:
Build - Same. Has priority over Trolls. Costs one less Minion.

## Boss Auto Actions:

Priority: Heal at closest shop or Build to Hub if needed. Then build to Player Huts, then Cycle.
Cycle: Intimidate Workers until no room in Hut, then build a hovels off Hut.

### Turn 5, 7, 9:
> Boss Steals a Public Worker.
> Build to Player Huts: Builds towards closest hut until non-hub path is complete. Hates straight lines.

### Turn 10:
> Intimidate : Steals one Worker from each Troll, going in order starting at closest. Troll can defend. Boss will attack 3x, and if he wins one, he gets the worker.

> No Private Minion to Steal? Strike instead.

Once complete, Builds Hovel off Hut.

### Turn 20:
> Intimidate: Total of 4 Workers. Builds Pit next to Hut.
Adds Hovel

### Turn 30:
Intimidate 2 More Workers, total of 6.

Upgrades Hut

### Retribution
If A Troll Challenges the Boss and Loses, you are prioritized for Intimidation as much as possible + damage around Hut, similiar to Tantrum.

### Boss Tantrums
For each child the Feast is short, the boss Damages one Path Join. The Boss will Damage (Break if already Damaged), every Path Join around a structure before moving onto the next one. The Boss will target structures in the following order:
Huts belonging to all Challenging Trolls, in order of most recently Challenged.
Closest Huts to last Hut visited, including own.
Closest Shops
Hub

### Fallen Boss
Will take residence in a hut. Heal Wounds until fine, Collect Children and Get Minions. Intimidate will hit him first.

# Win Conditions
## Biggest
The winner is the Troll Boss, if there is an unbroken connection between their Hut and the Bridge. Alternatively, the first player to become the Troll Boss is the winner.
## Greediest
The winner is the Troll with the greatest number of Private Workers, in case of a tie, one final Challenge between the two, to the winner goes the spoils. Alternatively, first Troll to reach 10 private workers is the winner.
## Friendliest
Any Troll who has an unbroken connection between their Hut and the Hub is considered to be a winner.

# House Rules
Closest cage or pit escapes during Conflict

Boss has to build a path to the Hub before building to Huts

Choose Boss Stats

No Damaging Path Joins, things are just broken.

Broken Paths are not removed from the board, are just unusable. Must be cleared with 'Destroy' Action.

Any conflict causes kids in nearest container to attempt escape
